  <p>
I am a Master’s student in Business Analytics at UC San Diego specializing in business intelligence, data modeling, and decision support. I build SQL-driven data pipelines and dashboards that translate complex operational data into clear, actionable insights.
  </p>

  <p>
My experience includes ETL development in Snowflake, financial variance analysis, KPI tracking, and predictive modeling using Python. I am particularly interested in analytics roles where data informs strategy, improves efficiency, and drives measurable business impact.

  <h2>INTEREST</h2>
  <p>
    Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy exploring a diverse range of video games — from MMORPGs and narrative-driven single-player titles to open-world adventures and casual games. My gaming preferences evolve alongside my life experiences. Recently, while preparing for my career, I’ve developed a particular appreciation for lightweight casual games that offer meaningful enjoyment in short sessions.
    <br><br>
    I actively follow emerging technology trends and enjoy experimenting with new tools and platforms. I am especially interested in advancements in artificial intelligence and generative models, and I regularly explore technologies such as Stable Diffusion and other cutting-edge systems through hands-on practice.
    <br><br>
    Traveling and immersing myself in unfamiliar environments is another important interest of mine. Experiencing new cultures and perspectives has broadened my understanding of both the world and myself. Although I once felt hesitant about stepping outside my comfort zone, I have learned that taking that first step often leads to the most meaningful and rewarding experiences. Through travel, I have strengthened my adaptability, confidence, and openness to change.
